红包的门槛金额按照什么金额计算?</h5>\r\n      <span>红包的门槛金额按照(选购菜品折后价 + 餐盒费)的金额作为计算门槛,即购物车显示的金额(7.3以上版本)。假设红包满30可用,只要选购的菜品现价(折后价) + 餐盒费超过30,就可以使用红包。</span>\r\n      <h5>Q4: 一个红包能拆开多次使用吗?</h5>\r\n      <span>不能,一个红包只能一次性使用,不能分开使用。</span>\r\n      <h5>Q5: 下单的时候使用了红包,但是后来订单取消了,红包还会返还吗?</h5>\r\n      <span>会的,订单无效后红包会自动返还到您的账户里。</span>\r\n      <h5>Q6: 红包兑换码怎样兑换成红包,怎样查看红包?</h5>\r\n      <span>在个人中心 >
